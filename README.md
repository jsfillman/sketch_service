# KBase Sketch Service

A genome "sketch" is a set of preprocessed data that makes it fast to compare genomes and get a similarity score. This is useful for doing genome searches, where you can find a list of similar genomes from a query genome.

This is a KBase dynamic (persistent) service that takes workspace IDs pointing to Assemblies, Genomes, or Reads and returns a list of similar genomes.

## Development

### Running the server

Build and run the server locally with:

```sh
$ make build && make serve
```

The app's directory will be volume mounted in the container, so you don't have to restart the server to see changes.

### Testing

With the docker server running on `localhost:5000`, run:

```sh
$ make test
```

There are some simple service integration tests located in `src/kbase/sketch/test/test_api.py`.

### Project anatomy

Important files:

* `kbase.yml` and `compile_report.json` are the main configuration required by KBase
* `entrypoint.sh` is the docker container's entrypoint script. The option with no arguments runs the python server.
* `Dockerfile` defines our container and `requirements.txt` defines our pip dependencies.
* The actual server code lives in `src/kbase/sketch`
